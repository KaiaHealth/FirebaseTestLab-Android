# Introduction
Firebase is actually the most popular developer tool platform, wchich handles almost every aspect of the app. It also gives possibility to run Android Tests on physical or virtual devices hosted in a Google data center through [Firebase Test Lab]https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/). In order to fully exploit the potential of this tool I've created plugin to simplify process of creating tests configurations. It allows to run tests locally as well as on you CI server.
